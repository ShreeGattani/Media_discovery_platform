STREAM SCRAPE -“Navigate the World of Entertainment, One Click at a Time”.

This project is developed as part of the KTJ Web Development and AI Workshop 2025, Assignment-1. It is a fully responsive media discovery website created using only HTML and CSS, adhering strictly to the assignment guidelines.

The website includes a fixed navigation bar with smooth scrolling, an animated SVG in the hero section, and separate sections for trending movies and popular shows. Movie and show cards feature images, descriptions, and interactive elements such as hover-based watch buttons and a CSS-only watchlist toggle.

CSS-only modals are used in the popular shows section to display additional content. A review section is included with sample reviews and a styled form for user submissions. The footer contains social media icons, external links, and a smooth-scroll back-to-top button.

All bonus features, including light/dark mode, mobile hamburger menu, responsive design, and animations, have been fully implemented without using JavaScript
